### The what

A simple Node/Express-server written in TypeScript to serve some static web content.

### The why

I wanted a Node backend with a frontend in pure JavaScript, without any fancy frameworks.

### The how

"npm run dev" to run locally.

"npm run build" to build for production.

"npm start" to run the production build.
